// A traceable implementation for GoldSrc BSP hulls.
//
// GoldSrc precomputes four collision trees per model: hull 0 (the point hull,
// stored as nodes + leafs) and hulls 1..3 (clipnodes), each already Minkowski-
// expanded for one fixed box size. A mover is therefore reduced to a POINT and
// swept through whichever hull matches its bounding box — that is what gives
// GoldSrc its exact plane normals and true 18-unit steps, with no trimesh seam
// jitter.
//
// The descent runs in native GoldSrc space (Z-up, inches) against the planes
// exactly as they sit in the file. The Godot-space query is transformed in and
// the result transformed back out; no plane is ever pre-baked, so no float error
// accumulates across a map's thousands of planes.

// Slop band on the "is this mover stuck?" test, in GoldSrc units. Contents is a

// a floor is exactly that point, and nothing survives the trip through a rotated
// entity's transform exactly. A standing player traces as the point at feet+36, which
// is precisely the floor's expanded top plane, so a hair of float error puts them
// microscopically inside the floor they are standing on, everywhere, all the time.
//
// On open floor that costs nothing: the escape is straight up with ~zero depth. It
// turns vicious next to a wall, because the wall blocks the upward candidate AND every
// sideways candidate is measured at the same height, so each one lands a hair inside
// the same floor and is rejected too. The only candidate left is the one that leaves

// GoldSrc's SV_HullForEntity sizing rule, on a mover's GoldSrc-space box size.
//
// One deviation, at the bottom end. GoldSrc's rule is `sx <= 8 -> hull 0`, which works
// there only because entities are built to fit the hulls: a projectile is SetSize(0,0,0)
// and a player is exactly 32 wide, so nothing lands in between. A host engine's bodies
// are sized by whatever the art wanted, and anything between 8 and 32 units wide used to
// be handed hull 3 — a 32x32x36 box, several times its size, expanded around a corner
// rather than its centre. A 12-unit satchel stopped 6 units short of one face of a wall
// and 26 short of the other.
//
// A sized hull is only the right answer for a mover that actually matches it, so below
// 32 units the trace uses hull 0 and inflates it by the mover's own radius instead (see
// trace_solid). That is what GoldSrc does with projectiles, and it is exact rather than
// approximate. Players and monsters are unaffected: 32 wide still picks 1 or 3 by
// height, over 36 still picks 2.
//
// It is not purely a fidelity improvement — hull 0 is the only hull without CLIP
// brushes in it, so a body that moves down here stops being blocked by clip geometry.
// For projectiles that is correct and is what GoldSrc does. A small body that DOES want
